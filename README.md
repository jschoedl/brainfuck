many thanks to Daniel B Cristofani for a nice
[intro](http://www.hevanet.com/cristofd/brainfuck/epistle.html) and [sample
programs](http://www.hevanet.com/cristofd/brainfuck/). pass your programs to
the interpreter to execute them. you can also declare a `DEBUG` environment
variable to get a dump of the inner state after every instruction: `DEBUG=1
node src/interpreter/js/brainfuck.js src/bf/squares.bf`
